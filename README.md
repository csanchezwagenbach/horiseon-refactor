# horiseon-refactor

## Description
Horiseon Marketing requested a refactoring of their company's homepage in order to streamline code, debug the site, and update html to render it with semantic elements. This refactoring, the code visible in this repository and now live, completes each of these objectives. The project afforded an opportunity to attain a deeper understanding in how to effectively read html documents and how best to organize their elements. Additionally, the bugged link in the navigation portion of the header was debugged and now functions as intended. 

Site is now live and visible [here.](https://csanchezwagenbach.github.io/horiseon-refactor/)
